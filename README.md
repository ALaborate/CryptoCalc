# CryptoCalc

This program is intended to be portable helper for calculations of RSA cryptosystem examples done by hand. It is done to allow understanding of code rather than efficiently do the job.

The main function is calculation of RSA key pairs along with supplementary information. Side features also include:
* building multiplicative group of keys (modulo L(N) where L is generic Euler function);
* building multiplicative group modulo N;
* evaluating any numeric expression in js. That comes into use on mobile devices that has no dev tools in browser.

You may download the only code file `rsa.html` from code directly or from latest release. Just keep in mind that releases here are often a bit outdated.
